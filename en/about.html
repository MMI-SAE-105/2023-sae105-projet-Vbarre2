        <p class="Titre">Biography</p>

        <p class="maintext">My name is Vincent Barré and I'm 19. I'm currently in my first year of MMI 
            (Multimedia and Internet professions).
            As part of this project, I'm keen to put my multimedia and Internet skills into practice,
             while exploring new ideas and collaborating with other creative minds. 
             My aim is to create a unique and memorable experience for users, using the latest technologies and pushing the boundaries of digital design.
            My approach to the subject of the film 'Interstellar' is based on a deep fascination with science fiction 
            and how it can be a powerful vehicle for exploring complex scientific concepts, 
            while at the same time provoking deep emotion and reflection.
            I'm also interested in the emotional aspect of the film and how it evokes strong reactions 
            in the audience. I analyse the actors' performances, focusing on the roles of Matthew McConaughey, 
            Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain, who bring emotional depth to the story.</p>
